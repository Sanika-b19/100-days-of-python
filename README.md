# 100-days-of-python
Starting the 100 Days of Python challenge to improve my coding skills. This repository will document my daily progress including code snippets, projects, and insights gained along the way.

# Progress Summary

Day 1-10: 
Over the first 10 days, I set up my Python environment and dove into the basics of the language. I learned about comments, escape sequences, and print statements. I explored variables, data types, and typecasting. I studied different types of operators, expressions, and worked on conditional statements, including nested and multiple if-else statements. Additionally, I was introduced to various modules. I strengthened these foundational concepts through hands-on projects and exercises.
