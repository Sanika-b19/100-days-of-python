# Using f-strings for string interpolation
name = "John"
age = 30
height = 5.8

# Simple f-string
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# F-string with expressions
print(f"Next year, I will be {age + 1} years old.")

# F-string with multiple variables
print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and my height is {height} feet.")
